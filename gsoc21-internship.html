        <div class="article">
            <p>Iâ€™m one of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC 2021) <a href="#">interns</a> contributing to the GNOME
                Foundation. And I'm contributing to the <a href="#">libsecret</a> project.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>libsecret is a library for storing and retrieving passwords and other secrets. It communicates with the "Secret Service" using DBus - gnome.org</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>To simply put, libsecret is a credential/secret/password manager. libsecret has a feature that you can use to store secrets in a file database or simply a file. This
                file is encrypted. And the key to encrypt this file is derived from the user's login password. This not an ideal situation. Because, the entire security of the file
                database relies on the user's login password. This situation can be improved if the key[s] are protected by hardware. This is when a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">TPM</a> comes into play.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Trusted Platform Module (TPM, also known as ISO/IEC 11889) is an international standard for a secure cryptoprocessor, a dedicated microcontroller designed to
                    secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://coindataflow.com/de/aktie/TRVG"><img class="cdf" src="./images/cdf.svg" alt="kurs trivago"></a>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you don't know anything about the TPMs I'd recommend watching, Using the TPM - It's Not Rocket Science
                    (Anymore) - Johannes Holland &amp; Peter Huewe talk on YouTube. TPM is a fantastic tool for everyday cryptographic scenarios. And it's not that hard to use
                thanks to <a href="#">tpm2-tools</a>. However, talking to a TPM via an API (or simply TPM programming) is not that simple.
                Actually, it's very similar to rocket science :) And there are no books or good developer resources on TPM programming. The lack of programming resources is a
                frustrating experience. However, the TPM developer community is fantastic. They have been helping me since day one.</p>
            <p>In simple terms, my goal is to <a href="#">extend</a> current libsecret file database
                encryption-decryption functionality to work with a TPM. So, the TPM will handle key generation, wrapping-unwrapping of keys and key storage processes. This is very
                exciting work! Honestly, this was not the case in my early stage of contributing to libsecret. I knew nothing about libsecret, computer security, cryptography or
                TPMs. Thanks to both my mentors and upstream <a href="#">TSS</a> (TPM Software Stack) developers, I'm confidently finding my
                way around the project. So, thank you <a href="#">Daiki Ueno</a> for guiding me through every step of the way from my initial contribution to
                making my final project proposal for GSoC. And thank you <a href="#">Anderson Sasaki</a> for helping me out with my questions every single
                day. Also, I would very much like to thank, upstream TSS developers <a href="#">Peter Huewe</a>, <a
                    href="#">Philip Tricca</a> and <a href="#">Andreas Fuchs</a> for helping me out with all things related
                to TPMs.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for my next blog post, "Hello World TPM!".</p>
